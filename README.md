## History
I made this template when my friend and I took part in a competition about websites, at that time I thought it was impossible to create a website with many pages without assistance. At that time our team consisted of only two people, one designer and one programmer, since then I developed the template this is so easy to use even though the initial version is very messy because there is less time to develop it in the end we have to refactor the header on 105 pages but thanks to this template we only need to change 2 files only, and finally we managed to win the race with 2 friends we won second place and he also used a template,
I hope this template will be able to help other people to develop their website

This template is based on nodejs and the template engine of adonisjs is called edge and assets management webpack mix from laravel
